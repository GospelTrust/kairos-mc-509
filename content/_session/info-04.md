## Instructions for Course Work

Each week’s course work will consist of required reading, quizzes, discussion posts and Zoom
sessions. Some weeks have required videos in addition to the reading.

Each student is to complete the readings and videos for that week. They are also to complete
the quizzes for that week. Each response is to be 600 words or less. For specifics as to the
requirements, please review the rubric which is contained in the syllabus. The quizzes will
account for 70% of a student’s grade.

In addition to the quizzes, each student is required to participate in a discussion for one
question which will be posted to the discussion board each week. Their initial post should be
similar to the type of work for a quiz question (see rubric in syllabus). Students are also
required to respond to at least one of their classmate’s posts (more is encouraged). The
discussion posts will account for 20% of the student’s grade. The discussion posts and required
responses are due by the end of each class week which is midnight, Saturday, pacific time.

There will be weekly Zoom sessions accounting for 10% of a student’s grade. The Zoom sessions
will be Sunday and Monday at 8:00pm Central Time. The student is to attend one session per
week. The sessions are offered on 2 days to make it easier for the student to attend one of the
sessions. Students should attend their assigned Zoom class. Grading for the Zoom sessions are
based on a student’s attendance and their participation in the discussion. If a student cannot
attend either session, they are required to watch the session on video, take notes and forward
their notes to the instructor. A link to the Zoom sessions will be provided.
