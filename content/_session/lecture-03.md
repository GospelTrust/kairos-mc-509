## Discussion Question

This assignment is an exercise in ministering forgiveness.

Hypothetically, imagine someone who has been abused (you can choose the specific type of abuse) comes to you for help. What would you say to them? How would you explain forgiveness to them? If they were reluctant to forgive, how would you help them past that obstacle? Would you lead them in prayer? If so, how? (Saturday)
