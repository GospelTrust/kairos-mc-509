## III. Academic Integrity / Plagiarism

Doing Your Own Work. Students are required to do their own work. Group study and review sessions are fine, and are encouraged. But when completing an assignment or writing a paper, students must do their own work. Similarly, when taking a quiz or an exam, whether in the classroom or online, students are to do their own work.

### "Closed Book" Quizzes and Exams

If a quiz or exam is "closed book," students are to take it without the aid of their Bible, any books, reference works, or notes. [Professors will designate whether an exam is closed book, or whether students may use their Bibles or notes, etc.] Using notes or other materials when taking a quiz or exam that is "closed book" constitutes cheating.

### Proper Attribution / Plagiarism.

For term papers & research papers, it is expected that students will read and use multiple sources. When referring to information that is commonly known, footnotes are not needed. However, if students use detailed information drawn from a specific source, they must give credit to that author; in specific, they must identify the book, author, and page # of the source. If failure to do so is an honest oversight, as a minimum, it will reduce the grade of a paper.

### Consequences for Violations of Academic Integrity

In the case of a violation any of the above, at the discretion of the professor and the Academic Dean of Kairos University, based on the seriousness of the violation, any of the following consequences may be imposed:

- The student may be required to re-accomplish the work or exam in question, or to complete a designated alternate assignment; such work will receive a maximum grade of "C".
- The student will not be given an opportunity to re-accomplish the work and will receive an "F" for the work in question. This may result in the student will receiving a grade of "F" for the course.

For repeated violations of academic integrity in more than one course, a student may be dismissed
from the university.
