## VII. Grading

### Attendance Requirements (classroom, or online group sessions):

As this is an online class the attendance requirements are to fulfill all of the assignments on or before the due date and to attend one of the two weekly Zoom sessions. If it is not possible to attend either Zoom session then the student must watch the video and submit notes to the instructor prior to the following Sunday night, midnight Central Time. Zoom notes submitted after this time will not be accepted.

### Penalty for Late Work: 

I will deduct 10% for each day an assignment is late. This includes posting and responding to comments on time. If there are extenuating circumstances which result in you needing more time (which I reserve the right to approve or deny), I need to be notified ahead of time. The grade determined by the rubric will be adjusted to reflect this.
