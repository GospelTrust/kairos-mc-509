  <p>
    Father, would you grace me with your presence and overwhelm my senses? Could you quiet my mind and heart and let my thoughts cease to plan and wander? Would you birth within me your thoughts and will that I would see through the eyes of Jesus those around me? Would you allow me to be an observer watching your work unfold in this land, stretching over the vast emptiness of our hubris and arrogance, and setting free the captives, broken and hurt? Allow me to see your light shine in this time of such darkness and despair. Let your kingdom be established in your Church, and the name of your Son Jesus be magnified in your Body. Father, be glorified and exalted; let your kingdom be established on this earth upon those that bear your holy name. Holy Spirit, help me take refuge under the shelter of the Father’s wings and lead me toward the shore of redemption in Christ.

    My thoughts are not your thoughts, and neither are my ways your ways (Isaiah 55:8). Trust in me, lean not on your understanding, and be still and see my salvation (Prov 3:5; 2Chr 20:17). The heart of my people will return to me, and I'll be their God, and they will be my people (Jer 24:7). Put your trust in me, find yourself in my love and your eyes will behold the wonderous things that I will do you have not heard nor seen before (1Cor 2:9). I know they that are mine and will lead them to safety (John 10:14; Ps 78:53). Be led by my Spirit and you will find your shelter under my wings (Ps 91:4). Put your confidence and hope in me. I'll fill you with all joy and peace in my Holy Spirit (Rom 15:13).
