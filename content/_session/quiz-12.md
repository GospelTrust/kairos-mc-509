    “Humility is not demeaning ourselves but exalting our God” (p. 105). Vallotton’s definition of humility deconstructs the notion that humility is self-humiliation. Humility is not devaluing and denigrating humanity created in God’s image but recognizing God’s greatness and the magnificence of His creation. The recognition and assessment of our identity in Christ, in light of His greatness, is humility. Humility ultimately is knowing the Lord has set His Church to be a beacon of hope for the world and that we should rise to pursue that Great Commission.

    My view of humility is similar to Vallotton’s definition in that I do not believe one must commiserate with calamities to be humble. Humility is expressed fully through the person of Jesus Christ, “Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God” (Phil 2:6). By studying the Lord’s obedience to the Father, we learn obedience — and humility — by studying Christ, “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered” (Heb 5:8). Christ did not assert His position even though He was God but through obedience to the Father, suffered and was “made a curse for us” (Gal 3:13). Paul describes the humility of Christ more fully in the Philippians 2:7, “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men” (Phil 2:7). I believe this is the essence of humility, Christ being God, condescended into our humanity. Humility is Christ assuming a form of a Servant, a Creator who serves His creation. Our Lord taught His disciples that humility does not annul His authority, instead because He has the authority, He can humble Himself, “If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet” (Jn 13:14). Finally, humility does not express itself in a single event, but it demonstrates through a sacrificial life, “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross” (Phil 2:8). Jesus’ humility is perfected in His death and resurrection demonstrating His love for us — and pursued all this with joy (Heb 12:2).

    I have learned from Vollotton’s expositions on humility and especially false humility, which can be detrimental to understanding and doing the Lord’s work. False humility dismantles the ground where we stand, inhibits our delight in a gracious God, and generally sets a foul ambiance where the light and life of the Good News should flourish. Vallotton has helped expand my view on humility by sharing his experiences.

    Humility is obeying the Lord in our worship of God, service to the Body, and love for the lost world.
