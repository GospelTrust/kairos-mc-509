After reading chapters 4 and 5 in [Experiencing the Father’s Embrace], take time to sit before the Lord in faith. Do two-way journaling about Eph. 3:17 with this question, “What do you want to say to me about being rooted and grounded in love?” Share what you hear as the Lord’s response without filtering it.

  <blockquote>
    That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.  (Eph 3:17-19)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I know your heart, and I know your thoughts; I know even the things that are not spoken (Eze 11:5). I understand even those things that you cannot formulate with words (Ps 139:4). Sometimes, you hide in a distant place, and other times dash to my altar (Ps 139:7; 43:4). Your thoughts are confusing even to you, but I understand them; I know your heart (Job 10:1; Phil 4:7). Remain in my love; it is a place, not a thing that you can perceive or even possess (John 15:9-10). Take no thoughts of what form you must take to approach me (Mat 11:28; 19:14; Isa 55:3); know that as you come in humility and faith, the blood of my Son will usher you into My presence — do you believe this (Jas 4:7,10; 2Cor 7:14)? Come boldly to Me because my love for you is rooted in my Son and what He has done on your behalf (Heb 4:16; 10:19). I take delight in having you come and sit with Me. Don’t be concerned with your decorum, nor should you be afraid of not maintaining the correct posture (Eph 3:12). My love for you goes beyond your understanding, and you can never respond adequately (Eph 3:19). Let my love saturate the core of your being and immerse yourself in the ocean of my mercy to receive the everlasting peace I have prepared for you in My presence (Mic 7:19; Is 26:3). Come, my son, stay by My side (Ps 27:4; 23:6; 84:4).
