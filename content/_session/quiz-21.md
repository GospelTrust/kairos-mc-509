  <summary>Analysis</summary>
  <p>
    My score was 127. I agree that my score reflects the Prince and Pauper Test scale accurately. According to the test, I’m 73 points from reaching my royal identity. The information that is missing from this test is the quantification of a unit of measurement. Without defining what constitutes a prince unit, statement 6 in part 2 requires a better and more detailed explanation, “I love myself and sense God’s pleasure in me.” Does “I love myself” mean I should try to hate myself less? Or does it mean I should adore my virtuous inner beauty? More importantly, how do these questions relate to the weight and scale compared to other questions? Ultimately, I was given a single classification number that identified me as not yet a prince but more than a pauper. Thousands of permutations would give the same score, but the character of these semi-princes would be vastly different.

    When I emigrated from Vietnam as a boy, I knew I must change. What I did not know was how difficult it would be. My dad took me to Middle School on the first day and checked me in. On the second day, I took the bus but could not tell the bus driver to stop and let me off (I also did not know which stop was my school), so he drove me to the end of his bus route. I learned quickly to adjust, adapt, and reconfigure my identities to straddle the morphing interethnic realities. At home, I was an Asian son, deferring my thoughts on behalf of the family’s needs. At school, I tried to acclimate to the American individualistic ethos, expressed my thoughts and opinions, or risked being sidelined. I did not have the luxury of introversion to ask, “Who am I?”
  </p>

  <p>
    What the apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 9:22 spoke profoundly to me, “To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some” (1Cor 9:22). As clay in the Master’s hand, Paul was molded and shaped for God’s purpose irrespective of his perceived identities. I do believe the Holy Spirit confirms with my spirit that I am a child of God, and nothing I do will ever change that (Rom 8:15; 2Thes 2:13-14); however, while I am in this flesh, I don’t have the luxury to search for the affirmation of my identities (in my circumstances, this might have resulted in multiple-personality disorder). I must share Christ, “Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved” (1Cor 10:33). Jesus condescended from His glory in coming to save us, “Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich” (2Cor 8:9). I have all
the riches of heaven through Christ’s inheritance (Phil 4:19). Still, it was by His death that I receive this inheritance (Heb 9:16-17). The world needs God’s love, and for me, to be loved is to love. The world needs to be reconciled to God through Christ’s ministry of reconciliation (2Cor 5:18). So, I pray that I have the grace to preach the gospel and endeavor to step outside of myself and follow Paul’s exhortation, “Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men” (1Thess 5:14).
