    The devil is an elusive tempter; his seductions are beyond my human strength to resist. I am spellbound like a moth to the flame effortlessly. Another psychological alibi for my transgressive behaviors is the idea that God will deliver regardless of my decisions. But the most insidious of my excuses for sin is indirectly blaming God for my transgression. I am in this predicament because this is God’s will for me. The Lord did allow the serpent to be in the garden to seduce Eve, and subsequently, through the woman (He made), corrupted the humans.

    Ascribing to the devil the ultimate power of seduction, though tempting, is not how the Bible describes the accuser. God only permitted the devil to operate within a set boundary; nevertheless, Jesus has erased the accusations against us and nailed them on His cross. You are not powerless against evil principalities and powers. By walking in the light of Christ, you have victory over these temptations (Col 2:14-15). Sin exists in darkness; when you travel in the dark, you no longer have fellowship with Jesus, who cleanses us from all sin (1 John 1:7). Frost describes walking in the Spirit as the “key to abiding daily in God’s love” (p. 187). Striving to eschew the bait of Satan orients your heart toward the darkness, and you will stumble (John 11:10). Rather, set your mind on the Holy Spirit, and your affections focus on the light of Christ where the fulness of joy and peace that surpasses all understanding (Col 3:1-2). As you continue to walk with Jesus in the light, the darkness fades to the background, and so will the devil’s voice.

    “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations” (2Pt 2:9) is the justification written on the sign pointing toward the road to perdition. Paul warns Timothy to “flee also youthful lusts” (2Tim 2:22); the young Joseph possessed this wisdom and fled from the seductress (Gen 39:12-18). Don’t trust your heart; it is easily enticed by lust, and we often fall victim to its destructive proclivities (Prov 28:26; 7:21; James 1:14; Deut 11:16; Job 31:27). Trust instead in the Lord with all your heart and don’t lean on your ability to figure things out in situations that will be beyond your control (Prov 3:5; 24:27; Luke 14:28).

    I don’t have the fortitude to overcome this temptation because God has not endowed me with the strength to master sin. “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Mt 11:28). When you face overwhelming odds that seem too great for you, turn to Jesus. The Lord is the Good Shepherd, who calls out for His sheep, and you will recognize His voice when your heart is quiet, and your ears are tuned toward heaven. “Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still” (Ps 4:4). The Lord looks for you wherever you hide (Luke 15:4); Jesus has not forgotten nor forsaken you (Heb 13:5). Don’t go further, be still and the Lord will find you and bring you safely home (John 14:3).
