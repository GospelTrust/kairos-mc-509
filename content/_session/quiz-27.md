  <summary>Prayer of Affirmation</summary>

  <p>
    Father, I thank You for the grace I have received (John 1:16). You are present in all my circumstances, whether joyous or in the valley of despair (Phil 4:6; 1Thess 5:18). You have been my help and my deliverer (Ps 40:17; 70:5). Your Holy Spirit confirms with mine that I am Your beloved (Rom 8:16; Song 6:1). The cross of Jesus Christ reminds me of Your love and sacrifice; You died so I can be set free from a guilty conscience (Heb 9:14; 10:22; Rom 3:24; 1John 3:20). The empty tomb reminds me of the victory over sin and death, allowing me access to the Father through Your blood (Heb 4:16; 10:22; John 6:44). Draw me closer to You, Lord; let us run together into the place You have reserved for us (James 4:8; Song 1:4). Cause me to drink from the fountain of life by the stream of everlasting peace where I find rest for my soul (Rev 21:6; 22:1; John 4:14; Ps 36:8-9; Isa 12:3). Lord, forgive my foolishness and show me Your countenance that my soul will finally be satisfied in Your everlasting love (Song 2:14; Ps 4:6; Acts 2:28; Num 6:26).
