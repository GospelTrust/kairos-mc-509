## Prompt

Slowly read “Father’s Love Letter” out loud in a room by yourself (found on p.241 in [Experiencing the Father’s Embrace]) or watch the video version. With this as inspiration, write your response to the Lord. It could be a re-stating of some of these statements, from your point of view. (Wednesday)

  <p>
    Your tenderness has lifted my soul from an obscured place where I hid (Isa 58:10). I went to the mountaintop and, many times, found myself in the depths of anguish, but You have always been the lifter of my heart and countenance (Psalm 139:7-8; 3:3; 145:14). Your immutable grace has been a faithful witness of Your love for me (Lam 3:22; Ps 36:5; 100:5). Father, I rest in the comfort of Your embrace as You spoke peace to my soul (Ps 85:8; John 16:33; 14:27). Take me deep into the knowledge of Christ, Lord I want to know Your will (2 Peter 1:2; 3:18; Eph 1:17; 3:19; 4:13). Call me, and I will come; lead me, and I will follow (John 10:4-27); let Your Word cleanse my soul (John 15:3; Eph 5:26). Holy Spirit leads me toward the heart of the Father (Ps 143:10; John 16:3).
