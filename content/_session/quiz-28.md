## Prompt

Slowly read “Father’s Love Letter” out loud in a room by yourself (found on p.241 in Experiencing the Father’s Embrace) or watch the video version. With this as inspiration, write your response to the Lord. It could be a re-stating of some of these statements, from your point of view. (Wednesday)
